# Movies-ETL by Ketaki
This project helps the client Amazing Prime with movie Datasets that can be used for their Hackathon. 
- These Datasets are obtained by the ETL process on data obtained from sources such as Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens websites, and eventually uploading them to a PostgreSQL database. 
- **The code is refactored and made reusabe by use of Pandas functions.**
- The ETL process is done in 4 steps and uploaded as four Deliverables in the Repository. 
- The Datasets and output screenshots are available in the Resources folder.
